It will improve Maintenance & error processing pages of Magento 2. We know there are many extensions for custom maintenance page but all of those add additional code logic in Magento and various admin settings.

Hence, motto of developing this extension is to simply update the styling of native pages instead of adding any fancy code.

Please note that there is no admin setting for this extension. As soon as it's installed, it will start doing what it means to.
